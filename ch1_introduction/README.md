# Introduction

Before we dive into the really fun parts – playbooks, configuration management, deployment, and orchestration, we’ll learn how to get Ansible installed and cover some basic concepts. We’ll also go over how to execute ad-hoc commands in parallel across your nodes using /usr/bin/ansible. Additionally, we’ll see what sort of modules are available in Ansible’s core (though you can also write your own, which is also covered later).
